## 🗓️ [Session Date: 11-06-2025]  
### ⏱ Duration: 2 Hours 

### ✅ What I Worked On
- Developing the user stories and edge cases for the PokePort project
- Decided on a storage format for the PokePort database 
- Designed the initial database schema 

### 💡 Why I Worked on This
- Clear user stories will let me know what to define as core functionality 
- By deciding on a storage format for the PokePort data, I can proceed with developing core functions to
  obtain that data. This also open a leaning stream for me to further enhance my knowledge in SQLite. 

### 🔍 What I Learned / Practiced
- I learned the importance of clear, thought out user stories and how the are used to decide core functionality.
- I've also began learning the basics of database design and SQLite.  

### 🤯 What Was Challenging
I found it challenging to trust in what I had wrote in my documentation and designs as being "correct" or "suitable". As I am not in industry, the documentation I am writing is a first, leaving me "is this correct?" or "should it look like this?". 

### 🧠 Key Insight or “Aha!” Moment
- The importance of user stories to help break down core functionality, ensuring focus on core MVP development.

### 🔄 Next Step / Todo for Next Session
- Research SQLite basics within Python
- Create `storage.py` file
- Write code that: Connect to SQLite file, creates the table, uses the schema design

## Week 1 Recap - Project Setup & Planning 
### Duration: Approx. 5-10 hours (spread across multiple sessions)

### ✅ What I Worked On
- Set up GitHub repository for PokePort
- Connected local repo to remote and pushed initial commit
- Created GitHub Project Board (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Created GitHub Issues for all Phase 1 tasks
- Wrote `project_scope.md` — defined the problem, user, MVP, and stretch goals
- Drafted `features_mvp.md` — listed core and optional features
- Sketched out timeline for an 8–12 week build

### Why I Worked On This
> Phase 1 of the PokePort project is all about defining the what, why, and how - setting a foundation for the whole project.

### What I Learned / Practiced  
- How to translate loose ideas into a scoped MVP
- Importance of timeline chunking to reduce overload
- Using GitHub Issues and Projects like real dev workflows 
- How to balance clarity and detail in Git commit messages.
- What features_mvp and project_scope documentation looks like
- How to effectively use Git branching to separate new features, documentation, and updates for cleaner version control.

### What Was Challenging
- Avoiding over-complicating / over-thinking documentation detail within `project_scope.md` and `features_mvp.md`
- Deciding what to defer to stretch goals to keep MVP realistic
- Getting comfortable with documenting even the planning phase

### Key Insight or "Aha!" Moment 
> Planning **is** an important part of development and although it can take longer than initially thought - it saves you from future burnout and messy rewrites

### Next Step / Todo for Next Session
- Write 5 user stories and priorities them in the dev log or as GitHub Issues
- Draft the basic card schema (e.g. name, set, condition, price, date)
- Decide on storage format: JSON for now or go straight to SQLite?

### 🔗 Git Commit(s)
> `git commit -m "Add initial dev_log entry summarizing Week 1 planning and setup"`
