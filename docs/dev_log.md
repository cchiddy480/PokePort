# Dev Log - PokePort    
> A session-based developer log capturing progress, learning, blockers, and insights throughout the build of PokePort: a PokÃ©mon Card Investment Tracker + Grading Estimator.


## Week 1 Recap - Project Setup & Planning 
### Duration: Approx. 5-10 hours (spread across multiple sessions)

### âœ… What I Worked On
- Set up GitHub repository for PokePort
- Connected local repo to remote and pushed initial commit
- Created GitHub Project Board (Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Created GitHub Issues for all Phase 1 tasks
- Wrote `project_scope.md` â€” defined the problem, user, MVP, and stretch goals
- Drafted `features_mvp.md` â€” listed core and optional features
- Sketched out timeline for an 8â€“12 week build

### Why I Worked On This
> Phase 1 of the PokePort project is all about defining the what, why, and how - setting a foundation for the whole project.

### What I Learned / Practiced  
- How to translate loose ideas into a scoped MVP
- Importance of timeline chunking to reduce overload
- Using GitHub Issues and Projects like real dev workflows 
- How to balance clarity and detail in Git commit messages.
- What features_mvp and project_scope documentation looks like
- How to effectively use Git branching to separate new features, documentation, and updates for cleaner version control.

### What Was Challenging
- Avoiding over-complicating / over-thinking documentation detail within `project_scope.md` and `features_mvp.md`
- Deciding what to defer to stretch goals to keep MVP realistic
- Getting comfortable with documenting even the planning phase

### Key Insight or "Aha!" Moment 
> Planning **is** an important part of development and although it can take longer than initially thought - it saves you from future burnout and messy rewrites

### Next Step / Todo for Next Session
- Write 5 user stories and priorities them in the dev log or as GitHub Issues
- Draft the basic card schema (e.g. name, set, condition, price, date)
- Decide on storage format: JSON for now or go straight to SQLite?
