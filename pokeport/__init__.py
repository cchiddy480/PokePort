__init__.py - Marks the pokeport directory as a Python package.

Why this file exists:
> This file lets Python know that 'pokeport' is a package. It's required for imports to work smoothly, especially as the project grows. For now, it doesn't need to do anything else, but it's good practice to include it from the start.
