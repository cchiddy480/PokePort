grading.py - Handles the logic for estimating the grading of a Pokémon card.

Why this file exists:
> Grading is a big part of the Pokémon card world. This module will eventually contain functions to help estimate what grade a card might get based on its condition (centering, corners, edges, surface, etc). For now, it's a placeholder as I learn more about grading logic and how to turn that into code.

Next steps:
- Research grading criteria (PSA, Beckett, etc)
- Write a function that takes in condition details and returns an estimated grade

# Placeholder function for grading logic
def estimate_grade(card_details):
    """
    Given card details (like centering, corners, etc), estimate a grade.
    For now, just returns a dummy value until I learn more about grading.
    """
    # TODO: Implement real grading logic
    return 7.0  # Just a made-up grade for now
