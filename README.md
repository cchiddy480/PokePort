# 🧠 PokePort

A Pokémon Card Investment Tracker + Grading Estimator — built as a hands-on learning project to develop real junior developer skills.



## 🎯 What Is PokePort?

**PokePort** is a free, open-source Pokémon TCG tracker that helps collectors organize their cards, estimate their grading outcomes, and understand the value of their investments. It’s built from scratch as a hands-on junior developer project to sharpen real-world Python skills and deliver something genuinely useful to the community.



## 🚀 MVP Features

PokePort’s first version will include:

- Add/update/remove cards in a collection
- Manually input card condition details
- Store data locally (JSON or SQLite)
- Estimate grading potential based on condition
- Show purchase value vs market value + ROI



## 📈 Stretch Goals (Future)

- Image-based grading assist (basic logic or AI)
- Market price tracking from external APIs
- ROI trend visualization
- Streamlit web interface
- Export reports for insurance or sales



## 🔧 Technologies

- Python 3
- SQLite (or JSON)
- [Planned] Streamlit
- [Planned] API integration (eBay / TCGPlayer)



## 🧪 Why This Project Exists

This project is part of a personal learning journey to:

- Improve problem-solving and modular design
- Practice version control, GitHub workflow, and documentation
- Gain job-ready skills in API usage, storage, and UI design
- Demonstrate a full dev cycle from idea to deployment

## ⚙️ Getting Started (Coming Soon)

Once the CLI or Streamlit version is operational, this section will include setup instructions. For now:

- Requires Python 3.10+
- Clone the repo and run scripts from `interface/cli.py` (once available)
